Please see [this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup]
for instructions on installing Git.

We have already installed Git as a module on SPECTRE. You can load it with `module load git/2.35.1`. We'll do our work in the `git-novice` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd ~
$ module load git/2.35.1
$ mkdir git-novice
$ cd git-novice
~~~
{: .language-bash}
